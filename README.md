Distributed coherence is a content governance model where consistency emerges from shared principles, patterns, and vocabularies rather than rigid enforcement from a single canonical source.

**The nutshell version:** Instead of requiring all content to flow from one master system (single source of truth), you equip distributed teams with the same decision-making frameworks, terminology, and quality criteria—so content created independently across touchpoints still feels unified.

**Why it matters: ** Enterprise content rarely lives in one place. You've got product teams, marketing, support, legal—all creating content in different tools on different timelines. Distributed coherence acknowledges that reality and builds for it, rather than fighting it with brittle centralization that breaks the moment someone needs to move fast.

**The tradeoff it navigates:** Control vs. speed. A "single source of truth" is foundational and gives you control but creates bottlenecks when you're trying to communicated across multiple channels. Total decentralization gives you speed but chaos. Distributed coherence aims for the middle—coherent enough to feel like one voice, flexible enough to actually ship.
