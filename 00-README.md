## What's in This Toolkit

Seven practical resources that turn the distributed coherence framework into action:

| # | Resource | Purpose | Use When |
|---|----------|---------|----------|
| 01 | **Coherence Markers Worksheet** | Define your non-negotiables | Starting out; establishing foundations |
| 02 | **Adaptive Content Patterns** | Create patterns that enable variation | Building content systems; onboarding writers |
| 03 | **Decision Framework Cards** | Enable distributed decision-making | Teams need to decide without escalating |
| 04 | **Content Source Types Matrix** | Apply appropriate governance | Setting up governance; classifying content |
| 05 | **Coherence Metrics Canvas** | Measure coherent purpose, not sameness | Tracking success; reporting to stakeholders |
| 06 | **Variation Rationale Log** | Document why content varies | Creating variations; building institutional knowledge |
| 07 | **Content Principle Cards** | Portable reference for decisions | Daily work; quick reference; onboarding |

---

## Getting Started

### The Quick Path (1-2 hours)

1. **Complete the Coherence Markers Worksheet** with your core team
2. **Review the Content Principle Cards** and customize for your context
3. Start using these in daily decisions

### The Thorough Path (1-2 weeks)

1. **Coherence Markers Worksheet** → Establish your foundations
2. **Content Source Types Matrix** → Classify your content portfolio
3. **Adaptive Content Patterns** → Create patterns for your top content types
4. **Decision Framework Cards** → Train teams on distributed decision-making
5. **Coherence Metrics Canvas** → Set up measurement
6. **Variation Rationale Log** → Begin documenting significant variations
7. **Content Principle Cards** → Deploy for daily reference

## Implementation Tips

### Start Small

Don't try to implement everything at once. Pick one content type that currently fights against single-source-of-truth thinking and apply the framework there.

**Good first candidates:**
- Feature announcements (email vs. in-app vs. marketing)
- Help content (different expertise levels)
- Error messages (different severity/channels)
- Product descriptions (different audiences)

### Build Institutional Knowledge

The Variation Rationale Log seems simple, but its value compounds. Start logging now—in six months, you'll have a library of reasoning that accelerates every future decision.

### Involve Resistors

The people most skeptical of distributed coherence often become the strongest advocates once they understand it. Include them in the Coherence Markers Worksheet session.

### Measure What Matters

Resist the urge to measure content consistency (identical words across channels). Instead, use the Coherence Metrics Canvas to measure what actually matters: whether users succeed across touchpoints.

---

## Common Questions

### "Isn't this just giving up on consistency?"

No—it's achieving *meaningful* consistency. Identical words aren't consistent when they're inappropriate to context. Coherent intent expressed appropriately is real consistency.

### "How do we prevent content from drifting?"

- Regular audits against Coherence Markers
- Variation Rationale Log for significant differences
- Coherence Metrics to catch drift early
- Principle Cards for daily alignment

### "How do we know when variation is appropriate vs. drift?"

The Decision Framework Cards provide criteria. If a variation is intentional, justified, and documented, it's appropriate. If it happened accidentally and no one can explain why, it's drift.

### "What about AI-generated content?"

The Content Source Types Matrix addresses this. Conversational content (including AI-generated) gets governed through principles and guardrails, not output review. The framework is AI-native.

### "How do we get stakeholder buy-in?"

Lead with the data: 81% of brands struggle with unified identity using current approaches. 57% struggle with personalization inconsistencies. The old approach isn't working—this is what works instead.

## Customization

These resources are frameworks, not prescriptions. Customize for your context:

- Add your organization's specific coherence markers
- Create patterns for your content types
- Adjust decision criteria for your risk tolerance
- Add metrics relevant to your goals
- Build principle cards for your values
